# Engitrum-club-week2
### Through this week 6 concepts of python programming was covered which are:
* sets.
* condition and branching
* loops
* functions
* exeption handling 
* object and classes


## Sets:
* The set is one of Python data types such as tuples, lists, and dictionaries which use to store data in a single variable.What distinguishes sets are unordered, unchangeable, and unindexed.
* To define sets we use curly brackets {}
### Exampel:
```
Set1 = {"seconed", "week",True,7}
print(Set1)

```
## Condition and branching:
* condition is used to determine which instruction will be execute
* branching is used to allow us to execute multiple instructions based on different conditions.
* we can use,if-else, multiple if, or else if, in order will check when the condition is true do " something" otherwise go to another statement.
### Exampel:
```
a ="red"
b ="blue"

if b==a:
  print("Yes,it's equal")
else:
  print("No,it's diff")

```
